This project is a console-based Java application that simulates an on-demand fuel delivery system, similar to modern real-time service platforms. It allows customers to order fuel online, choose fuel types, make secure payments, and get fuel delivered to their doorstep by registered delivery drivers. The system supports customer login with OTP verification, wallet and UPI-based payments, automatic delivery driver assignment, real-time order status updates, and detailed billing. The application is designed using core Java concepts such as OOPS, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, multithreading, exception handling, collections, and user input handling through Scanner.
